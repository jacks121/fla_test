# Task Plan: Documentation Refresh

## Goal

Update all project documents to reflect the current POC implementation (frontend + backend + login + history).

## Phases

- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [x] Phase 3: Execute/build
- [x] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions

1. What has changed since the original POC plan (auth, backend, history)?
2. Which docs need to reflect current endpoints and UI flows?

## Decisions Made

- Rewrite each plan doc to match actual features, endpoints, and limitations.
- Keep Chinese language and current date references consistent.

## Errors Encountered

- (none)

## Status

**Currently in Phase 4** - Documentation updated and aligned with current implementation.

# Task Plan: POC Backlog and Iteration Plan

## Goal

Create a POC-focused iteration plan and requirement backlog using mock data and mock QR codes, updated for a single-page mobile web app.

## Phases

- [x] Phase 1: Plan and setup
- [x] Phase 2: Research/gather information
- [x] Phase 3: Execute/build
- [x] Phase 4: Review and deliver

## Key Questions

1. Which flows must be demonstrated in the POC demo?
2. What is the minimum data and UI needed to prove the workflow?

## Decisions Made

- POC uses mock data and mock QR codes only.
- Focus on a demoable workflow rather than production readiness.
- POC is a single-page app for mobile browser access.

## Errors Encountered

- None yet.

## Status

**Currently in Phase 4** - Review completed and ready to deliver.
